This project is the first mobile application project I have done with react-native, which I prepared within the scope of mobile application development course.

I used Stack, Tab and Drawer navigation while doing this project.
I also developed my project using Firebase Firestore, Push Notification and Authentication

Within the scope of this project, I designed a mobile application project by meeting the requirements requested from me. In this project, I designed my application considering the scenario of a bus company using this application. In this Application, users would be able to query their bus tickets on the route they chose and purchase tickets. In addition, I have added an extra page to this project where they can access the latest news of the bus company and view the details of these news. In addition to these, since I use user authentication in the project, I enabled users to register to the system using their mail and passwords with the help of firebase, and then to log in to the system by verifying this information. Finally, I added push notification to my project to keep users up to date with the latest news.
